Benchmark aim:

- Measure the potential number of messages the server can deliver in a time unit (i.e. second), given the size of the message and the client connection strategy.

Benchmark procedure:

- A script able to start and stop the server.
- Create X clients Monitor, which connect to the server and record the messages being received.
- Create Y (possibly constant, possibly function of time) clients Sender whose only purpose is to send N messages per time unit.
- At the end of the benchmark the Monitors' recording will be collected and possibly charted.

The client connection strategy can have an impact on the outcome of this benchmark where the connection to the server interferes with the broadcasting task.

Notes:
- remember to pin the clients to a set of cpus, possibly independent to the ones dedicated to the server, if it is run on the same host.
- the client would have to avoid creation of any garbage, so that GC won't skew the results.
